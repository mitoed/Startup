# Startup - Activity Anarchy
 For CS 260 - Web Programming

Pressure Point: Deciding on and beginning group activities can be difficult. Group members sometimes do not share actual preferences, they do not fairly make a decision, or one person dominates the conversation.

This application will help to deal with the first part of this pressure point: deciding on a group activity. Further development may address the second part (beginning the activity), but will not be covered during the CS 260 project.

Below are the steps of this project and their descriptions:
