# Startup - Activity Anarchy
 CS 260

Pressure Point: Deciding on and beginning group activities can be difficult. Group members sometimes do not share actual preferences, they do not fairly make a decision, or one person dominates the conversation.

This application will help to deal with the first part of this pressure point: deciding on a group activity. Further development may address the second part (beginning the activity), but will not be covered during the CS 260 project.
